      <p>It is a game that consists of playing with tree leaves</p>
      <p>The principle is the player chooses the tree leaves he wants to have</p>
      <p>And the player who choose his leaves mustn`t show it to other players</p>
      <p>and compares them with that of his opponent</p>
      <p>the game is played in turn</p>
      <p>the player shows the tree leaf to his opponent</p> 
      <p>and if he doesn't have that leaf then the opponent loses lives</p> 
      <p>but if he has the same leaf as you, his life remains the same</p>
      <p>To win you must have the leaves that the opponent has</p>
